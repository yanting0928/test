#this example is for caculation

#how to use the sign like + - * %

print "I will now count my chicken:"

print "Hens",25+30/6
print "Roosters",100-25*3%4#the result of % is remainder

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3+2+1-5+4%2-1/4+6#the priority is () exponents * % + -

print "Is it ture that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 ?"#if the formula is right,then output ture,otherwise false

print 3+2<5-7

print "What is 3 + 2 ?",3+2
print "What is 5 - 7 ?",5-7

print "Oh,that's why it's False."

print "How adout some more."

#then the same as before

print "Is it greater?",5>-2
print "Is it greater or equal?",5>=-2
print "Is it less or equal?",5<=-2
